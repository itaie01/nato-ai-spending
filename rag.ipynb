The European Union expects the  private sector and its member states at the national level to complement this investment, reaching at least EUR 20 billion invested by the end of 2020. It is also expected that the private sector and EU member states will continue investing at least EUR 20 billion annually for the next ten years in AI R&D. Funding through Horizon Europe and the new Digital Europe programme targets AI research, innovation and deployment, and the development o f digital skills.  Support for AI R&D also includes grants to establish centres of excellence. This includes EUR  20 million to build the European Network of AI Excellence Centres (AI4EU), a European online platform that allows the exchange of AI tools and r esources.

The AI HLEG comprised representatives from academia, civil society, and industry that produced three outputs: the April 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, the June 2019 Policy and Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy Artifici al Intelligence, and the July 2020 Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI). The European AI Alliance is a multi- stakeholder forum for engaging in a broad and open discussion of all aspects of AI development and its impact on the eco nomy and society.  In February 2020, the European Commission issued a “White Paper on Artificial Intelligence” – A European Approach to Excellence and Trust. The paper considers requiring a pre -marketing conformity assessment for “high -risk” AI applications  such as facial recognition, as a core element of a potential regulatory framework for AI.  In addition, the white paper proposes a voluntary “quality label” for AI applications considered not to be high -risk. In parallel, the European Commission is review ing EU product safety and liability regimes in light of AI.  Read more:  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/artificial -intelligence .
